# Summary

We are going to be creating our own ride sharing service, RUber!  There is a lot of data that needs to be managed because we are going to have like a billion users within a month.

# Technologies

The data is pretty simple and we want scalability and flexibility above all else so we are going to use ReactJs, NodeJs and MongoDB. Nearly all of our use of the data will be in basic inserts and reads.  Perfect for an MongoDB!


# Timeframe

You have about a day (+- 2 days) to build the entire frontend + backend for RUber.  

# Backlog

Here is a backlog that our team of investors has created for you to complete:


As a developer
I want to perform CRUD on all users
So that I can register and login and disable my customers

As a user
I want to be able to login
So that I can view my profile

As a developer
I want to perform CRUD on all rides
So that I can see that data pertaining to the health of my business

As a user
I want to be able to upload a profile picture 
So that I can customize my avatar

As a user
I want to be able to rate a ride
So that I can give valuable feedback

As a developer
I want to make sure all endpoints have proper error handling
So that I know when the back end team messed up

As a developer
I want to create a log of all API requests
So that I can help in debugging the app


-- STRETCH GOALS --

As a developer 
I want to associate a user id to each ride item
such that I can look up all rides given a user id

As a user
I want to be able to login and get all rides associatd with my account
So that I don't have to worry about other users rides / data

As a developer
I want to be able to estimate the time of a route
So that my customers can determine how long a certain ride will take
